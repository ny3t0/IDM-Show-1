Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many office jobs were converted into full-time remote jobs for the past two years, thus further blurring the lines between digital and physical reality. Drawing on Marxist feminist theory, which argues that massive technological shifts have historically reversed women's progress, I created Cyber-Woman to explore the ways in which remote work technology has negatively impacted women. \n\nCyber-Woman is an augmented reality zine that uses essays in combination with collage, AR, and 3D scan art pieces in order to discuss the various ways in which remote work technology can act to oppress women. I used these mediums in order to convey that the blurring of physical and digital reality are working to harm women. The zine works by using QR codes that link to the AR experiences that are uploaded onto Instagram.",

    "Long Description of your work (4-6 sentences)": "When it comes to Transportation-as-a-Service (TaaS), there are specific features that are intended to support users with accessibility needs. Some of these include wheelchair accessible cars, audio cues, screen reader enabled apps, etc. While these cover areas in motor, hearing, and visual disabilities, there is still a lack of research and solutions for cognitive disability needs for transportation in general and TaaS.\nThis thesis will explore attitudes and experiences of parents and caregivers of individuals with neurodiversity and cognitive impairments (e.g. autism, ADHD, memory loss, etc.), specifically when deciding transportation methods (e.g. personal car, public transportation, ride-share services). This exploratory research is designed to provide information on the experiences of parents / caregivers caring for those with cognitive disabilities and neurodiversity. It is hoped that specific information from this thesis will assist in developing relevant functions for assistive technologies in the Transportation-As-A-Service (TaaS) sector.",

Initially I scouted out really nice places in the city which I could just look at and just gaze at, and eventually deeply think and wonder about.Then I start to take some notes on how I feel or what I can imagine or think about in the scenes or areas I am in. I then try to find the perfect shot, whether it be freehand with my camera or set up carefully with a tripod. My final step is to create the perfect compositions based on my imagination and feelings through photoshop. My overall goal is to display these views of the city through the eyes of me and my vivid imagination, I want my work to portray a sleepwalking or ethereal type of feeling.",
